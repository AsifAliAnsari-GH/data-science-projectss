Developed a machine learning model to identify fake news articles. Used NLP techniques for feature extraction and various supervised learning algorithms for classification. Achieved high accuracy through model optimization and implemented a user-friendly web application for real-time analysis.


Project 1 - Fake News Detection
This project will address the following key challenges:
1. Detecting fake news from a large and different dataset The dataset of news papers
may contain a wide range of motifs, sources, and styles, making it challenging to
identify patterns and characteristics of fake news. The design will address this
challenge by collecting a different and representative dataset of news papers and
conducting thorough exploratory data analysis to gain perceptivity into the
characteristics of the data.
2. Developing accurate and interpretable models The design will employ colorful
machine learning algorithms and point engineering ways to develop models for fake
news discovery. The models need to be accurate in prognosticating fake news while
also being interpretable, meaning that they should give explanations or perceptivity
into the factors contributing to their prognostications. Interpretability is pivotal for
erecting trust in the model's prognostications and understanding the decision- making
process of the models.
3. Addressing implicit impulses and ethical considerations The design will precisely
dissect the performance of the models and address implicit impulses, fairness
enterprises, and ethical counteraccusations in the discovery of fake news. It's
important to insure that the models don't introduce new impulses or immortalize
being bones , and that the ethical counteraccusations of using automated models for
fake news discovery are completely considered and bandied.

Project 2 -

Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms. Customer churn refers to when customers stop using a company's product or service, and predicting churn is critical for businesses to retain their customers and optimize their marketing strategies.

Project Overview-
In this project, I worked with a customer dataset to predict whether a customer would churn. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and applying several machine learning models for churn prediction. 
The models used include:
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key trends and patterns in the data.

Model Training & Evaluation: Training multiple machine learning models and evaluating their performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results: Achieved an accuracy of 86% using [Best Performing Model].
